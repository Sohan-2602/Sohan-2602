            <p>The United Kingdom currently has six institutions in the Global University Rankings with the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge both scoring 100% when it comes to their academic reputations. There’s a reason why the UK produces 14% of the world’s most cited research papers!</p>
            
            <li>A Cheap Study Destination
</li>
            <p>The UK is substantially cheaper than other English-speaking study abroad destinations such as the US and Australia when it comes to paying for higher education. Tuition fees in the UK sit between at least £2,000 and £3,000 cheaper than the United States and Australia.</p>
            
            <li>Highest Student Satisfaction Rating</li>
            <p>The UK boasts one of the highest student satisfaction rates amongst English speaking countries, with over 90% of the whopping 2.32 million students in the UK happy with their experience.</p>

            <li>Set Time Out to Physically Lock Your Phone</li>
            <p>One of the keys to cutting down your screen time is to be disciplined. Picking out a period of time each day to step away from your device is a great way to limit screen time. Most devices today have a “Do Not Disturb” setting that allows you to turn off notifications entirely. With this setting, typically you can even schedule a time to be on “Do Not Disturb”. Of course, this won’t prevent you from picking up your phone to scroll through social media or play games.</p>
            
            <li>Monitor Screen Time Reports on Apple Devices</li>
            <p>On iPhones and other Apple devices, you may have noticed that a Weekly Screen Time Report is provided. This gives you the average hours you spend per day on your screen. It even shows you which apps you are using and how frequently you use them. Monitoring this will help you be aware of the amount of time you spend on your device and will help you better plan for spending less time on it.</p>
            
            <li>Setting a Time Limit for Browsing Through Social Media Apps</li>
            <p>You can always do this by setting aside a chunk of your time mentally. However, apps like Facebook, Instagram and YouTube actually allow you to set a time limit for the amount of time you can spend on them. How does it work? The apps will send you a reminder when it’s time to log off. This feature is easy to set up and definitely holds you accountable for managing your time.</p>
